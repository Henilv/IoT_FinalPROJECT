Import the necessary libraries mentioned in notebook.

With the dramatic growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly while the all the systems suffers from security vulnerabilities, which could increase the attacks that could negatively affects the economy. Therefore detecting vulnerabilities in the system in the network has been more important and need to be done as accurate as possible in real time.


The process of modeling means training a machine learning algorithm to predict the labels from the features, tuning it for the business need, and validating it on holdout data. The output from modeling is a trained model that can be used for inference, making predictions on new data points. Various models are trained and evaluated on the dataset.

Optimization techniques are used to improve accuracy and converge on global minima over local minima, futurescope can include use of momentum etc. as underlying optimization to converge in fewer epochs.
